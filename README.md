# ‚úçÔ∏è Doodle Recognizer
A processing app that uses openCV and Google Input-Tools to recoginze your drawings by camera. This project was created a part of the module Media Computing at FHNW by our team.

In order to use it:
1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/)
2. Install `openCV`, `Video` libraries in Processing
3. Download repo & run in Processing
4. Doodle something on a white paper (‚ù§Ô∏è and üö™ work pretty well üòÑ)
5. Hold it in front of the camera, so that you can see the green contures of the object in the middle area.
6. Press any key on the keyboard
7. Be hopefully blown away by the results. (They pop up as quickly as your internet conntection can handle it)
